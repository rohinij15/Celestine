          <th class = "usText">Hey! My name is Rohini, a high schooler! Something I have been doing during quarentine is cooking and doing more art. This is a website I am passionate about as we as a community have been scared to go or open shopping or take-outs again both as constomers and local businesses since there is a risk of contracting the virus. This website allows the customer and local business to realize each others efforts they will put forth to stay safe and keep others safe. It also allows the local business to advertise themselves to reach people who might be interested in their products. We named this website Celestine as this jewel is transparent and we would like to create the business and customer communication and understanding as transparent in these covid-times.

I am passionate about this website because there are so many small businesses espacially this year, that have been put out of business or lost profit. This website would help so many local businesses get free advertisement and more customers. I would absoultely love to be able to help out our community.<p>  </th>
