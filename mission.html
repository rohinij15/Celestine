The website allows owners to give options to customers on how they would like their interactions to be made in order to stay safe and confortable during the covid times. Local businesses can also add their links to their website, donation pages, pictures, videos and they can also give a description of their business. The website would provide advertisment of their business to their community members and also allow people to be interacted with their community.<h4> </center>
